# PowerPoint 3Dbox

Short VBA code to generate 3D box from base edges.

I sometimes wanted to draw sipmle 3D box on some picture that matches the perspective. By manually drawing bottom edges and using this macro, it's easier for me to draw 3D box.

Steps:
1. select freeform tool and define base edges using three points.
1. select one more point on which one of the top edges passes through.
1. finalize freeform and run the macro.

See examples below.
